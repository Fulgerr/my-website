## Automation asset updates

### Introducing RealVNC for live streaming and remote control

If you know and love our live streaming and remote control feature, then you will already be aware that it is supported by a VNC server. Up until now, this has been TightVNC, but, with the advent of the Robot 2023.12 release, we are moving to RealVNC.

RealVNC is included in your Studio installation package, and requires no configuration whatsoever. Nothing changes on your part - if anything, things should be smoother from now on. However, this means that we will no longer be offering support for TightVNC.

For details, see the [Live streaming and remote control via RealVNC](URL) section in our user guide.

### Retention of recorded videos

We have changed our retention policy for recorded videos. Now, when you choose to record a job execution from the settings of its underlying process, the video is stored in Orchestrator as follows:

- for 7 days in the case of failed jobs
- for 3 days in the case of successful jobs

### Hiding processes for attended users

You now have the option to hide a process from the automations list in Assistant. This way, you can prevent users from running processes that you may not want them to access. To do so, you simply need to enable the "Hide process for attended users" option at the process level.
