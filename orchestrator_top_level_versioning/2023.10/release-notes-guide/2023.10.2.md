## Bug fixes

### Security vulnerability fix

Added March 11, 2024

We have discovered an issue with the permissions for exporting queues. An authenticated user who has access to one or more queues within a folder may be able to export data from all queues in their tenant instead of only the ones they have permissions for. The issue does not allow access to other tenants or other organizations.

To overcome this, we strongly advise you to apply the latest cumulative update for your installed version.
