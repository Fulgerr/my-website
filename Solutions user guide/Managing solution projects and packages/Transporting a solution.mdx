# Transporting a solution package

You can transport solutions from an environment to another by downloading and uploading solution packages.

To download a solution package, take the following steps:


1. 
  Select the **Solutions**  tab at tenant level.
2. 
  Find your solution package and access its corresponding three-dot button, then **Download latest version**. This allows you to download and share an archive containing the solution package with others.

To upload a solution package to your tenant, take the following steps:


1. 
  In the **Solutions**  view, select the desired tenant.
2. 
  Select **Upload solution package**. Add your files in the newly open panel.

> **Note:** Successful package uploading on a tenant requires that all resources contained in the package match the enabled services for that specific tenant. If any services are disabled, you have to wait for 30 minutes after enabling them before trying to upload the package again.
