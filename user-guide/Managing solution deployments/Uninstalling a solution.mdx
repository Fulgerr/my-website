# Uninstalling a solution

You can remove a solution deployment from a tenant by uninstalling it in an automated manner. The uninstall operation removes from the system the solution folders and all the resources included in it that were created as part of the deployment. However, uninstalling a solution does not delete entities, choice sets, and webhooks. Note that you cannot undo the uninstall operation.

To uninstall a solution, take the following steps:


1. Select the **Solutions**  tab at tenant level.
2. In the **Deployments tab**, find the solution you want to uninstall, select the three-dot menu corresponding to it, then choose **Uninstall**.
3. Type the name of the solution deployment in the newly open window to confirm the action, then select **Uninstall**.
