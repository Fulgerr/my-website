# System User Entity

The System User entity holds all the users, groups, and robot accounts available in your tenant.

A banner asking you to upgrade is displayed when you access any entity created prior to the release of the System User entity:

The upgrading process converts the type of Created By and Modified By fields from UniqueId to Relationship.

Processes using Created By and Updated By fields must be updated to query the relationship to identify users that created or modified the records, and use the latest version of Data Service activities.

BehaviorEntity records are synchronized with organization users and they are updated periodically. The System User entity cannot be deleted or modified by any user. Modifying data in the System User entity is possible only by submitting a service request. Users, groups, or robots are mapped in other entities by relating to the System User entity through a Relationship field type; Created By and Updated By system built-in fields are populated by the records of the System User entity. Records created by users who were removed from your organization prior to the System User update display Deleted User for Created By and Updated By fields.
