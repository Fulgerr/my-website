# The User Interface

The Data Service option is available in your UiPath organization as a tenant-level service that must be enabled. Please check the Enabling the Data Service page for step by step details. Once the service enabled, the Data Service icon  appears on the left navigation bar.

Objects created in Data Service are referred to as Entities.

To create a new entity or display and manage already created ones, click the Data Service icon.

Several options become available:

* Create a new entity
* Customizing the entity by creating new fields
* Creating relationships between your created entities
* Use an already created entity in Studio

To see the list of languages Data Service is available in, see the Language Support table.

The option to switch the language preference is available from the user menu.
