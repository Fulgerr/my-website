# Editing a published solution project

You can edit a published project so that you can apply any of the following changes:

- Changes to the solution structure: add or remove solution components;
- Changes to the component properties.

To edit a published solution project, take the following steps:


1. Select the **Solutions**  tab at tenant level.
2. Navigate to the **Projects**  tab and locate the solution project you want to modify. Select the three-dot menu, then proceed to edit the targeted version.

   The **Solutions builder**  now opens.
3. The **Solution explorer**  and **Component properties**  panels are now open, allowing you to make the desired changes:

   - Changes to the solution structure: add or remove solution components;
- Changes to the component properties. > **Note:** If you make changes to read-only component properties in the source environment, you must use the **Sync**  functionality to fetch the latest data.

As a general rule, you can update any of the configurations that were also editable at initial depoyment time. However, there are some properties that you cannot change if they were configured in a certain way, as is the case of the store in encrypted format for queues.
4. Once you are done making changes, select **Publish**. You have now created a new solution package version.
