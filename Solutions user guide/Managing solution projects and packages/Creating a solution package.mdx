# Creating a solution project

This step is typically performed by an RPA developer.

To start building a solution, take the following steps:


1. Select the **Solutions**  tab at tenant level.
2. Select the **Projects** tab then the **New project** button.
3. In the **Create solution project**  window, provide a name for the project and, optionally, a description, then select **Create**.
4. Once the **Solutions builder** is open, select the **+** button to start building your solution by adding components from the selected tenant.
5. In the **Components** panel, select the components you plan to include in your solution. Note that you can only observe the components you have access to in the source environment.!['Solution components panel' image](Resource tree=GUID-98EC4344-E08F-46E7-9462-28D42F0FC285=1=en=Default.png)
6. Select the components included in your solution to view and optionally update their properties in the **Component properties** panel. Note that there are two types of properties:
  - Read-only properties - Changing these properties may break the solution. The only way to change read-only properties is by going back to your development environment and making the changes. Then, come back to the Solution builder to remove the old component, then reimport it to fetch the latest info.
  - Configurable properties - If you know that different values are required in the target deployment environment, you can configure these properties to ease the deployment experience. You can also change these properties within the deployment wizard if needed. > **Note:** In cases where property differences across environments exist, and the correct values are uncertain during the solution packaging process, it is recommended to leave these fields blank by removing the default values.

This way, it is easier to notice which fields require specific input during the deployment phase.

7. To generate a solution package, select the **Publish** button in the upper-right corner of the **Solution explorer** window, and provide the following details in the newly open panel:
  - **Solution root folder name** - Mandatory. The name provided at deployment time for the solution root folder. The administrator can change it when performing a deployment.
  - **Package name -** Mandatory.
  - **Package version** - Mandatory.
  - **Description** - Optional.
8. Select **Publish**.
9. Return to the **Solutions** view in Orchestrator. You should now observe your newly created packages in the **Packages** tab.

> **Note:** You can interact with the aforementioned flow at any time and return to the **Projects**  tab to resume work on your project.
