Otherwise, Data Service rounds up the number to the maximum value of decimals, causing uniqueness failure. For example, if you set a precision of three decimals and input values such as 3.015 and 3.0148, the latter value is rounded up to 3.015, leading to uniqueness failures.The option is case insensitive, meaning "Unique Value" and "unique VALUE" are identified as duplicates.Click More details to configure optional field record properties, such as',":Maximum"," LengthFor Text fields, set the maximum number of characters a user can provide.By default, up to 200 characters are allowed.Maximum ValueFor Number fields, set the maximum value a user can provide.Default maximum value is 1,000,000,000,000.Minimum ValueFor Number fields, set the minimum value a user can provide.Default maximum value is -1,000,000,000,000.Decimal PlacesFor Number fields, set how many decimal digits a user can provide.Default value is 2, which allows numbers with two decimal digits, such as 23,45.Default ValueSet a default value in case users do not provide data.DescriptionAdd a description for the field.Role based field accessSelect this option to restrict data access by granting explicit permissions.Optionally, to keep the Create Field wizard open, select the Create another checkbox.
