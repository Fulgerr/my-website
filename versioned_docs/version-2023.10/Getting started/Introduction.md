# Introduction


## Overview

UiPath® Data Service is a persistent data storage service that brings powerful
            no-code data modeling and storage capabilities to your Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
            projects.

UiPath® Data Service provides a business yet user-friendly service where you can securely
            store and manage your business data within UiPath:

* Run unattended processes to aggregate
                data from multiple systems before processing it in other systems.
* Use the data for long-running
                business processes that need to transfer data across multiple attended and
                unattended processes.
* The integration with Studio and
                    UiPath® Robot allows you to build automations leveraging capabilities such
                    as: Rich relational data types; Integrated security; Instantaneous and adjustable
                        provisioning and deployments.


## Use Cases

Below is a list of some common use cases for Data Service:

Capturing data about employee
                needsSay you create a new process for capturing data about employees
                needs (i.e. desks, chairs, webcams, etc.).Problem: The data can be
                extensive and must be stored before creating requests in the procurement
                    system.Solution: Instead of using a database, a file share, or
                cloud storages, you can store them in UiPath® Data Service.

Monthly financial
                reportingProcesses for monthly financial reporting get data from multiple
                systems like bookings, invoices, billings, and payments.Problem: Both
                attended and unattended workflows retrieve this data every time they run. This
                requires all users to have access and connectivity to all the backend systems, which
                can cause delays and inconsistencies in reporting, as underlying data may change
                before all your processes are completed.Solution: You can write one
                unattended workflow to gather all the required data in Data Service. Then, all your
                other attended or unattended workflows can work with it. This may also eliminate the
                need for storing the aggregated critical business data in files on user or robot
                machines.

An orchestration process using
                queuesSay you design an orchestration process that includes human-robot
                interaction for payments of supplier invoices and transfers all the data via
                queues.Solution: You can store the invoices in Data Service, pass
                around the record ID via queues, and work with one version of the truth. You can
                also create new processes to provide full visibility on all invoices in your system
                from Data Service.

Review customers before inputting
                them in CRMSay you are working on an unattended business process to
                create a 360-degree view of your customers before you write it in your customer
                relationship management (CRM) system.Problem: The workflows
                have tens, maybe hundreds of variables.Solution: You can model your
                customer entity in Data Service, import the definition in Studio, and work with a
                single variable in your workflows before dispersing it across your various systems
                of record. Data must not necessarily be stored in Data Service.


## Benefits

* Secured, persisted, and accessible
                storage that enables you to keep all your data in a unique central place.
* Seamlessly access your entities,
                records, and documents for all your UiPath ® products.
* Store completely new and also
                existing data.
* Define, modify, and extend business
                entities and store records for those entities apart from the standard out-of-the-box
                features.
* Define rich metadata like
                relationships, rules, attributes for your entities, and store documents associated
                with the defined entities.
