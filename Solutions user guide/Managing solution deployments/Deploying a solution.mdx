# Deploying a solution

This step is typically performed by an administrator.

To deploy a solution, take the following steps:


1. Select the **Solutions**  tab at tenant level.
2. Indicate the solution package you plan to deploy. Your options are:


  - Select one of the existing solution packages available in your tenant;
  - Create a new solution package;
  - Upload a solution package from a different tenant.
3. Deploy the desired version of the solution package using its corresponding three-dot menu.
4. In the **General details** screen, review and update the following details:
  - **General information** - Read-only. Review the package name, version, description, and author;
  - **Folder selection** - Indicate the folder to be used as a parent folder for the solution root;> **Note:** - The solution is not deployed in the selected folder; a new child folder is created.
    - Solutions create folder components in a new dedicated solution folder. This ensures subsequent operations are clearly scoped and do not conflict with elements outside of the solution, such as a manually created component bearing the same name as a solution component.
  - **Install as a new root folder under tenant** - Use the checkbox to install as a new root folder under the tenant;
  - **Solution root folder name** - Optionally change the root folder name, which you previously configured in the Solutions builder.
5. Select **Next** to go to **Overview & Configuration**. Now you are prompted with the **Solution explorer**, which allows you to review the solution components, component properties, and files. Take the following into consideration:
  - You can filter the component properties to only show read-only, configurable, or empty fields.
  - You can link existing components. For details, refer to [Linking components](Linking and replacing components=GUID-59349F5F-C884-4F34-B604-0C55F3759188=1=en=.xml).
6. You can now save your solution as a draft or validate it and continue. The following image shows several typical validation errors.!['Validation errors' image](Conflict resolution=GUID-CE7EFB60-9DA0-4CF2-B50E-04DF12A63AAF=1=en=Default.png)> **Note:** If a component of the same name already exists in the tenant, your options are the following:  - Keep the existing component and do not create an additional one.
  - Keep the existing component and add additional new fields from the solution. Note that this option does not alter existing fields.
  - Rename the conflicting resource in the respective service (for instance, Orchestrator, Action Center) in the target tenant.
  - Rename the resource in the solution deployment if possible.
7. Select **Deploy**, for  to orchestrate the deployment across all affected services. A deployment can be successful or it can fail. You can view the deployment status in the deployment grid.

The following table describes the possible statuses of your deployment:

| Status | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| In progress | The deployment operation is in progress. |
| Successful | The status changes from **In progress**  to **Successful**, and all components are deployed. |
| Failed | The status changes from **In progress**  to **Failed**. In this case, an automatic rollback performed successfully. You can check the activation summary for more details and retry the operation. |
| FailedRollback | The status changes from **In progress**  to **FailedRollback**. In this case, since some components have already been deployed, make sure to manually clean up the components from the failed services. |

For an overview of all deployment statuses, refer to [Checking the deployment status](Checking the deployment status=GUID-10D64DBC-7E3C-4B76-91D2-62B366F4F0FE=2=en=.xml).
8. To complete the deployment, take the following steps. 
  1. Add accounts and assign roles - Add user or robot accounts to the solution folder(s) and assign the required roles and permissions.
  2. Add machines - Make sure machines are assigned to the solution folder(s) that include processes.
  3. Define account-machine mappings - Define account-machine mappings if needed or use dynamic allocation.
  4. Define values for assets per robot - Define value(s) for assets per robot, if applicable. This step is not needed for assets set with global values.
  5. Activate the apps used in the solution - If the solution contains apps, you must activate them using the provided link. Note that a new window opens, and you must wait for the apps activation confirmation before continuing the deployment activation.

> **Note:** If the solution contains apps, and you do not activate them using the provided link, the deployment activation fails.
  6. Fill in bindings for process-type components - If the solution contains processes, you must fill in any desired bindings. For example, editing agent-type processes allows the selection and usage of tools external to the solution.
9. In the **Deployment**  screen, select **Activate deployment**. Activation enables your triggers.



# Linking and replacing components

# Linking components

The solution package contains all components required for your solution to function in a new environment. By default, all components are created in the target environment during deployment.

However, there are situations where some of the required components are already available in the target environment, and you would prefer reusing them instead of creating a duplicate.

To link an existing component, take the following steps:


1. Select **Link to existing** in the **Solution installer**.!['Link to existing' image](link to existing=GUID-1AD67087-5498-4283-89D7-AFECF91E54F0=1=en=Default.png)
2. Select the existing component you want to link to from the **component name** dropdown list.!['Link to existing component' image](Link=GUID-7F0E35A7-0FC1-4625-B16E-45C201EE693A=1=en=Default.png)
3. Select **Link**.

When linking an existing component, the solution references it and uses it instead of creating a new component as part of the solution deployment.

This functionality is available for the following components:


- Assets
- Storage buckets
- Webhooks
- Queues
