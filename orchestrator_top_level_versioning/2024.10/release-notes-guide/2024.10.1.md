Release date: December 18, 2024

## Bug fixes

- When you attempted to download more than one file from a storage bucket, the first file downloaded successfully. However, when you downloaded the second file, the first file would download a second time. The issue occurred for storage buckets that had the pre-signed URLs disabled for external storage.
- When using style attributes in the HTML tags while customizing your Login page, they reflected accurately in the preview. However, upon saving the changes, the style attributes were deleted automatically. Now, all style attributes used within tags persist after saving your changes.
